# Howdy! 
Welcome to a free and open source Sudoku app created in React Native with the help of ChatGPT!

## How to run:
1. Install dependencies and start server
'''bash
yarn install
yarn start
'''
2. Download Expo Go from your phone store
3. Scan the QR Code

## TODO:
1. Eliminate all unused dependencies from package.json
2. Add a cheat "Solve Puzzle" functionality
    a. That a user can see the whole solved sudoku
    b. Hint: Tap a cell and click hint. Max 3 hints per game
3. Change the game mechanic: Instead of clicking the button number first, click the cell first and then select a number to put there
4. Add a rating feature: Prompt the user to rate the app after 10 minutes on it
5. Add a donation feature: After 20 minutes, prompt the user if they want to donate. Leave the option in the home page or somewhere where it doesn't affect the experience
7. Publish to both stores! (And Huawei store if possible)

## Future improvements!
1. Add gamification
2. Add competition features
3. Add SSO with Google and Apple
